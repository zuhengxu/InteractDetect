""" KL-Divergence estimation through K-Nearest Neighbours

    This module provides four implementations of the K-NN divergence estimator of
        Qing Wang, Sanjeev R. Kulkarni, and Sergio Verd√∫.
        "Divergence estimation for multidimensional densities via
        k-nearest-neighbor distances." Information Theory, IEEE Transactions on
        55.5 (2009): 2392-2405.

    The implementations are through:
        scikit-learn (skl_estimator / skl_efficient)

    No guarantees are made w.r.t the efficiency of these implementations.

    # usage to est KL(p||q)
    # both X_p and X_q are numpy arrays of shape (n, d)

    X_q = torch.randn(1000, 2)
    kl_pq = skl_efficient(X_p, X_q, k=1)
